# Deric Panet-Raymond IoT Test submission

This application uses Docker Compose to instantiate the three different containers.  There is a mongodb instance that is used to store 
the device data, a simulation application that use Express, React, and Node to create the RESTful interface and the UI for interacting
with the simulation and finally the Dashboard, a Node/Express container that uses Websockets to receive the device data from the Database.  
Whenever the database is modified through the REST interface an "device_data" event is generated which contains all the device data from 
the DB.

## Required Software

* Docker
* Docker Compose

## Deploying

Download or checkout the project, the root directory should container a docker-compose.yml file.  To start run

```
docker-compose up --build
```
This will kick off the container download and build process and launch the containers.  When completed you should be able to see three containers running

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES

```

## Console Output

This application has been tested on a Macbook Pro running High Sierra 10.13.4.  It was tested on Windows, but the simulator was not able to connect to the Mongo container.  it was also tested in a Linux VM, and things start but the Simulator application seems to have a pathing error I wasn't able to resolve in time, I believe it has to do with running the containers in a VM.

You might see the following in the docker-compose command output when you first start

```

```
This is normal, the mongo instance hasn't had a chance to start properly and so the simulator app will try to reconnect every second until it is succesful  you will see the following message when it's connected

```
simulator    | Connected!
```

## Connecting to the Simulator

open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000

## Connecting to the Dashboard

open a browser and go to http://localhost:4000/devices

## Operating the Application

Use the simulator to add / delete / edit device entries.  Once the change is completed the Dashboard will fadeout and fade back in with the new data.
